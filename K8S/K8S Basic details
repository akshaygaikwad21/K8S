              KUBERNETES [container orchestration tool]


      cluster
      nodes{ Master node, Worker nodes}
      pods  (smallest unit of deployment in k8s)

  Master node components
 1) API server >            Route the request
 2) ETCD  >                 Store the data here
 3) Scheduler >             Schedule the nodes(server)
 4) Controller Manager >    keep the resources in your desired state
                            (current state = Desired state)

  Worker node components
 1) Kubelette >             create the pod and monitor it
 2) container runtime >     provide environment to create container inside pod
 3) Kube-proxy >            provide the networking (ip-addresses) to the pod

   
Pod > smallest unit of deployment in k8s
    > wrapper in which we create containers 
    > we can create multiple containers in one pod 
    > pod has its own ip address
