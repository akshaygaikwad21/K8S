- Deployment is used to manage and maintain the pods.
- also, we can keep the pods in running on a perticuller time.
- use for stateless application like frontend and backend.

- 2 types of policies are available.
  
  1) Rolling update
  2) Rolling back.


  1) Rolling update:

      - In this policy the pods are automatically updates when we make some changes in the manifest file.

  2) Rolling Back:
      - 


    There are also some strategies are available:

    - Rolling update strategy ----> Recreate the pods and then destroy the old once.
    - Recreate stategy --->          Recreate all at once and destroy at once.
    - Canary deployment.
    - Blue-green deployment.


    

    ** StatefulSet-
      - In StatefulSet the previous state matters.
      - It is use for Stateful application like DB.
      - All pods are start from SS, have unique identity which start from 0.
