- Deployment is used to manage and maintain the pods.
- also, we can keep the pods in running on a perticuller time.

- 2 types of policies are available.
  
  1) Rolling update
  2) Rolling back.


  1) Rolling update:

      - In this policy the pods are automatically updates when we make some changes in the manifest file.


    There are also some strategies are available:

    - Rolling update strategy ----> Recreate the pods and then destroy the old once.
    - Rcreate stategy --->          Reaceate all at once and destroy at once.
